# 📊 Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on building interactive Tableau dashboards to help stakeholders such as sales managers and executives analyze sales performance and customer behavior. The dashboards provide clear year-over-year (YoY) comparisons, highlight key trends, and enable data-driven decision-making through intuitive visualizations, filters, and dashboard actions.
